Three OPTIONAL Tips
Below are three tips that can help you optimize the program according to your needs. While optional, they can significantly enhance your experience using Terminal Watson.

# [TIP #1]: Update the Watson Assistant credentials in the .py file with your own custom credentials from IBM. This will greatly enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the program.

# [TIP #2]: Depending on your requirements, you may want to train your Watson Assistant with various skills to change how it processes and responds to prompts. For example, you may train it for general conversation, technical support, or any other specific area.

# [TIP #3]: Feel free to experiment with different dialog nodes, slots, and entities in your Watson Assistant to enhance the richness and variety of the AI's responses.
